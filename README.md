# WEBDOS
Digital information often comes as collections of unsorted offline documents. For example, a user could
have a set of folders with personal photographs or PDF documents generated during a project. Sharing
such collections on the Web is a complicated process, often requiring the use of a document
management/archiving tool or the submission of all documents to a socal media site. Many people use
Facebook or Flickr as their photo album because there are few other simple options.

The goal of this project is to create a static website from a collection of documents, including any
metadata and creating browse and search interfaces that are all static HTML/JS as well. The system must
support: metadata in Excel/XML files; different browsable views (e.g., by date, folder); search through
the metadata; thumbnails (using a third party tool); and configurable styling.
